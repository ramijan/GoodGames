WDI Project 2 - GoodGames
<br><br>
This is my second project for the General Assembly WDI course.  It is a website where gamers can add games to collections (like goodreads.com) and can rate and review those games.  
<br><br>
This is a Ruby on Rails application using MongoDB for the database.  The GiantBomb API powers the search and provides all the game data.
<br><br>
The app will be deployed on heroku here:
